# GanoGraphic

## About
***
GanoGraphic is a ste*Gano*graphy generator which allows users to embed their messages within an image and share the image wherever they please so that any authorized recipient can decrypt and view the message using their own PGP private key.

This application, implemented using MATLAB for its superior image processing, may act as a second layer of encryption for peer-to-peer based encrypted communication (i.e. OpenPGP or RSA).
